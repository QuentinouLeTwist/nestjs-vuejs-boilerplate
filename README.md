# nestjs-vuejs-boilerplate
A boilerplate using nestjs and vuejs frameworks.

Useful to start a new app without carrying of implementing features like user authentication, user api, password encryption and so on.

Free to use, to clone, to fork, to evolve, to do anything you want.

# Backend
- [x] A starter API (with User)
- [x] MYSQL - Typeorm
- [x] User Password Hash/Compare
- [x] Authentication JWT Token

# UI
- [] Login Form
- [] Profile Page

More features will be added.

# Docker

I used a docker-compose file in order to let you compose with other services (like redis) if needed.
